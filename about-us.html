            The Comox Valley Lifeline Society is a non-profit, charitable organization that provides Lifeline services to a variety of individuals who may feel reassured that help is available to them twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. The Society was established in 1988 by the 'Lions of the North Island' because the membership believed
            that people deserved the dignity to live on their own and have access to immediate help in an emergency situation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Volunteers are the back-bone of the Society and their participation is important to the success of our program. Volunteers work diligently to provide our Clients with high quality service including: equipment installations, service calls, maintenance calls and the promotion of the Lifeline Services. These dedicated people make it
            possible for our Society to offer our services at a reasonable price.
